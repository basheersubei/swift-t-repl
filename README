This is a Jupyter kernel for Swift/T, written in Python. If you connect to it using a Jupyter client, you will be able to use Swift/T as a REPL of sorts.

Check out http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/ for documentation, specifically the page about simple wrapper kernels (which this kernel is based on).


To install Jupyter: simply run `sudo pip install jupyter`.

To install this Jupyter kernel, run `sudo jupyter kernelspec install </path/to/this/folder/swiftkernel>`.

To run the kernel, run `jupyter console --kernel swiftkernel`. Note, you have to be in the same directory as the swiftkernel.py file (unless you placed that file somewhere in the JUPYTER_PATH).


Don't forget to go into the repl_leaf folder and read the README. You will have to setup the repl_leaf Tcl packages so it can be called from within Swift/T (which this kernel calls).
